# SimilarityMatrixAggregation
Python code for computing the average of multiplex similarity networks based on the paper "Similarity matrix average for aggregating multiplex networks" by Baccini, Federica, Barabesi, Lucio, Petrovich, Eugenio (2022).

The repository contains the following .py scripts:

- **functions.py** contains all the functions that are used to compute the matrix averages. Comments on the specific functions input and outputs are included in the script.

- **toy.py** is a toy example for computing the matrix average of three 2x2 matrices. The average is computed with the three methods presented in the original paper.
